<h1>Naming and Using Variables</h1>
-> Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.
They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message. <br>
-> Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used
to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works
but greeting message will cause errors. <br>
-> Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.
For example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Python
has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See “Python
Keywords and Built-in Functions” on page 466.) <br>
-> Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is
better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better
than length_of_persons_name. <br>
-> Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O
because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
